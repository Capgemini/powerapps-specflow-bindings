Feature: Entity Sub Grid Steps
	In order to automate entity sub grid interaction
	As a developer
	I want to use pre-existing entity sub grid bindings

Background:
	Given I am logged in to the 'Mock App' app as 'an admin'
	And I have created 'a record with a subgrid and related records'
	And I have opened 'the record'

#Scenario: Search in subgrid
#Scenario: Switch subgrid view
#Scenario: Assert aliased record not in subgrid
#Scenario: Assert count of subgrid records
#Scenario: Assert subgrid contains aliased record
#Scenario: Assert subgrid contains mulitiple aliased records
#Scenario: Assert subgrid contains a record with a given value in a given column
#Scenario: Assert subgrid contains a record with a lookup to an aliased record
#Scenario: Assert subgrid contains records with lookup to multiple aliased records
#Scenario: Assert a command is visible on a subgrid
#Scenario: Click a flyout command on a subgrid
#Scenario: Assert a command is not visible on a subgrid
#Scenario: Assert that a command is visible on the flyout of a subgrid
#Scenario: Assert that a command is not visible on the flyout of a subgrid
#Scenario: Click a command under a flyout on a subgrid
